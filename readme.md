# sfti.me -- An Interactive timeline of science fiction.

Simply, sfti.me uses [VisJS](https://visjs.org/) to create an interactive timeline of science fiction. The dates in the timeline are the dates in which events in a variety of SF occur. Of course, this is bound to Gregorian calendar dates, but it aims to include as many as possible. Data is hosted in a simple [JSON file](https://github.com/sftime/sftime.github.io/blob/master/static/data/data.json).

Please note: this site as built and is maintained by an English PhD, not a web developer, so please forgive any ineptitude you might find in this repo (including the million commits over CSS styling), and if you feel like contributing anything (improved code or items to the timeline), by all means please do so.

## Built with:
* JQuery (for handling a simple AJAX call)
* VisJS: for all the heavy lifting, I simply styled the timeline and added content
* Bootstrap: for content organization and usability
* Jekyll: hosted on GitHub Pages, Jekyll is being used to generate static pages and content pages
* FontAwesome: for a few glyphs here and there
